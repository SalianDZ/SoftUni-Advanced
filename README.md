Description:
Welcome to My Advanced CSharp Exercises! This repository showcases my journey through the advanced C# course at SoftUni. Here, you'll find a collection of practical exercises that I completed, demonstrating my progress and understanding in various crucial topics covered during the course.

Topics Covered:

📊 Multidimensional Arrays: I've explored the versatility of multidimensional arrays in C#, mastering the manipulation of data structures with multiple dimensions.

⚖️ Stacks and Queues: I delved into the fundamental concepts of stacks and queues, acquiring the skills to efficiently manage data and solve complex problems using these powerful data structures.

🔍 Sets and Dictionaries Advanced: I've learned about sets and dictionaries in C# and their advanced functionalities. This knowledge has empowered me to store and retrieve unique values and key-value pairs effectively.

🌊 Streams, Files, and Directories: I've gained expertise in working with streams, files, and directories. Through hands-on exercises, I've honed my file I/O operations and learned efficient data processing techniques.

🔗 Functional Programming: I've discovered the power of functional programming paradigms in C#. By leveraging concepts like lambda expressions, higher-order functions, and immutability, I've been able to write elegant and concise code.

🏗️ Defining Classes: I've grasped the principles of object-oriented programming and learned how to define custom classes. By appropriately designing properties, methods, and constructors, I can now model real-world entities effectively.

🔗 Implementing Linked List: I've developed a deep understanding of linked lists and their implementation. Through hands-on exercises, I've mastered creating, manipulating, and traversing linked data structures.

🎛️ Generics: I've explored the concept of generics in C#, enabling me to create reusable and type-safe algorithms and data structures that can work with various types.

🔁 Iterators and Comparators: I've acquired the skills to implement custom iterators and comparators in C#. This proficiency enhances the flexibility and functionality of my code, enabling efficient iteration and sorting.

In this repository, you'll find well-organized code solutions. These annotations provide insights into the rationale behind each implementation. Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt the code to suit your own needs.

I'd like to express my gratitude to SoftUni for providing the advanced C# course materials and exercises that have contributed to my growth as a programmer. 🎉
